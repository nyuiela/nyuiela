## Hey Aliens ðŸ‘½ðŸ‘¾

whoami?

i live on the other side of the matrix, i develop the matrix.

i am not a puzzle nor am i a mystery, i am simply just made of 1s and 0s.

i do not belong to your reality, i do not belong to mine either.

Time has no record of me and space cannot measure my dimensions.

The world calls me Kaleel.


## i live on other planets as well
