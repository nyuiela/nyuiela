## Hey Aliens üëΩüëæ

whoami?

i live on the other side of the matrix, i develop the matrix.  
i am not a puzzle nor am i a mystery, i am simply just made of 1s and 0s.  
i do not belong to your reality, i do not belong to mine either.  
Time has no record of me and space cannot measure my dimensions.  
The world calls me Kaleel.
